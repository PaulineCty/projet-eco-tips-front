# Welcome to Eco-tips

## What is Eco-tips?

Eco-tips is a web application that allows its users to reduce their ecological footprint and save money in a fun way.

In the current context, an increasing number of citizens are aware of the climate challenges and need to take action in their daily lives to reduce their carbon footprint. France's economic context also leads people to reduce their daily expenses.

To meet this need, Eco-tips offers its users eco-gestures based in part on a study by CLER - Réseau pour la transition énergétique, helping them to both save money and live more sustainably.

Therefore, Eco-tips provides a fun solution that encourages individuals to awaken their ecological awareness, permanently adopt eco-gestures in their daily lives with the goal of reducing users' carbon footprint. The application informs users about new practices while creating a community of engaged citizens.

## How does it work?

The way Eco-tips works is pretty simple:

- Create an account
- Obtain a card, called "eco-tip", that describes an action that will help reduce your carbon footprint and save you some money
- Then chose a deadline for this particular card
- When the deadline is reached, validate the eco-tip and gain some eco-coins
- Obtain new cards with these freshly acquired eco-coins

## Can i do more?

Of course! If you are very involved in the ecological domain and like this application you can create and propose your own eco-tips!

It's realy simple: you'll just have to fill out a form. Then an admin will check your input and if the card you created is great it will be added to the website.

Not enough? The users also have the ability to share their accomplishment with the other site's members when validating an eco-tips. If you are lucky enough, it might even be displayed on the home page.

## How to initialize the project

Again it is very simple :

- create a `.env` file using the `.env.example` file example,
- open the terminal and go to the project folder,
- type `yarn` to install all the dependencies,
- then type `yarn dev` to launch the project in dev mode,
- Enjoy!

This is a prototype version, hence there are still some minor bugs to be repaired, please be patient with us :)
